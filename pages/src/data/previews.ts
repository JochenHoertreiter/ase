/*  curated Unique-Selling-Point (USP) highlights

    Each entry pairs one USP (distilled from the project `README.md`) with one
    demo recording from the `ase-media` repository, which is published to
    GitHub Pages at https://rse.github.io/ase-media/ as `<video>.mp4` (with a
    `<video>.jpg` poster). Only the strongest USP+video pairs are surfaced
    here to keep the "Highlights" page tight and punchy.

    `Section-Previews.astro` alternates the USP/video column order per row,
    so the order below is also the visual top-to-bottom order on the page.

    Each entry also carries the Lucide icon `Widget-Video-Row.astro` renders
    in front of the headline. Where the showcased skill has an icon elsewhere on
    the page -- in the methodology strip or the "Day in the Life" timeline --
    the very same icon is reused, so one skill reads as one symbol throughout.  */
